This somewhat redundantly named crate provides an abstraction for representing
turn based games.

Todo:

* Extend `game::State` with an optional method for producing a set of game
  states along with isomorphisms betwen them and the current state. This would
  be useful in search space reduction in the case that there are various
  symmetries in the game that could be exploited.
* Consider adding game combinators. Such as parallel or sequential composition
  of games. While perhaps an interesting exercise, whether these would be of
  general utility beyond computational game theory is questionable.
